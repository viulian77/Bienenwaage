This is a projet for reading Beehive Parameters (Weight, Temp, Hum) and write them onto a SD Card and/or send the over a LoRaWan so it can be seen in realtime from home.
The project runs on Arduino Uno with 4 Modules:
    - 4 Weight sensors in a wheastone bridge and connected over a ADC
    - a RTC DS1307 to have a realtime measurement basis
    - a LoRaWan shield
    - SD card shield (the Ehernet port on the shild will not be used)

A part of this project is also documented on ww-iv.webnode.com
